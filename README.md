# HolidotsCard2016
This was my 2016 holiday card. It is a greeting generator that uses either user-media, uploaded files, or stock x-mas imagery as the base for icons-based halftone animations. Built with p5.js, webcam.js, and gifShot.js, it invites users to save their animated xMas card gifs and send the kitschy imagery to their loved ones.

### Quick Start

This was developed prior to my experience in node, but it can easily be run locally.

First clone this respository and then work with Node.js's simple HTTP server package. To install:

* npm install http-server -g 

To run (from your local directory):
* http-server . -p 8000

### Prerequisites

p5.js, webcam.js, gifShot.js (node.js for ease)

### Authors

This project was created by Meg Studer, as practice for working with different types of form/media input and the web version of processing.

### Acknowledgments

This project may be messy, but it was an excellent exercise in pulling together different visual libraries and getting to now all the blob-conversion options when dealing with the canvas.
